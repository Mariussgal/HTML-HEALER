# HTML-HEALER
üåê Introducing HTML Healer: Your go-to solution for diagnosing and fixing HTML code effortlessly! üõ†Ô∏è Say goodbye to buggy pages and hello to flawless web experiences. Perfect for developers and web enthusiasts alike.

## Description
This Python script is designed to parse HTML files and identify common errors such as unclosed tags, missing images with an empty `src` attribute, and the use of obsolete tags. It leverages BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing, `tqdm` for displaying a progress bar during processing, and `colorama`, `sys`, and `textwrap` to enhance its readability.

## Features
- **Unclosed Tag Detection**: Identifies tags that have been opened but not properly closed.
- **Missing Image Detection**: Identifies images without a `src` attribute or with an empty `src` attribute.
- **Obsolete Tag Identification**: Detects the use of tags that are considered obsolete in modern HTML standards.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Python libraries: `BeautifulSoup`, `tqdm`, `colorama`.

## Installations to be Made
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by executing in the terminal: pip install beautifulsoup4 tqdm colorama


## Usage
To use this script, run it in your terminal: `python main.py`

When the script is executed, you will be prompted to provide the path to the HTML file you want to parse, like so: 
`Enter the path of the HTML file: C:/path_to_your_file`                                            
(Please replace `C:/path_to_your_file` with the actual path to your HTML file.)

After the analysis, the script will display the results directly in the console, organized into three categories: unclosed or malformed tags, missing images, and obsolete tags.
